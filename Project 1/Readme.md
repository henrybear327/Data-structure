# Project 1

## Stack and Queue -- Walking rats in a maze

# Notes

It's a good idea to try [this problem](http://140.116.249.152/e-Tutor/mod/programming/view.php?a=11600 "ITSA 38 [Problem 4] 迷宮路徑") first.

A common pitfall --> moving right and left is changing the column value
by 1 instead of the row value!!
